/// This is just a sample place holder of how a router could be used, the router should only be used inside the presenter
/// if there is something that needs to be presented
/// Currently the stream inside the presenter is using a driver cause I rather not error and show a message everytime, since its making
/// so many fast requests as the user is typing, I rather just return an empty error
